FE March 2016 final project README file

Form functionality is limited by the lack of server side programming. 
Responsiveness was created by using REM for font sizes thus being relative to parent so when viewing through console 'toggle device mode' it is responsive and use of "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
Kept bigger font and black and white for easier visual effectiveness.
Angular implemented. [app.js]
